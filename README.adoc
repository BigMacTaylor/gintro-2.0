This repository contains bindings from the Nim programming language to the GTK3 _GUI_ (_Graphical User Interface_) library and related libraries. (With minimal fixes
it should also work for upcoming _GTK4_.)

https://nim-lang.org/[Nim] is a modern universal programming language.

https://www.gtk.org/[GTK], also known as the _Gimp Tool Kit_ and now sometimes also called _Gnome Tool Kit_, is a Graphical User Interface library.

NOTE: Later we will insert at this location a nice picture of a fancy Nim GTK3 GUI. Such a picture is fine to attract users and indeed is a good motivation.
But such pictures are no real evidence for the quality of a GUI toolkit -- the concrete example may look nice, while the toolkit
looks much worse in other environments and offers by far not all that what is needed in real life. 

While GTK was initially designed and advertised as cross platform GUI toolkit, it is currently mostly used on _Linux_ and other _Unix_ like operation systems.
Most Linux distributions include it, and some use it for their default desktop environment, often with the Gnome environment or other window managers.
While GTK2 applications like _GIMP_ are still used on _Windows_, there seems to exist currently only very few GTK3 applications for Windows or _{MAC}_.
When you develop primary _free open source software_ (_FOSS_) for Linux or other Unix like operating systems, then GTK3 is a good choice for you. With some 
effort you should be even able to port your application to the proprietary Windows or {MAC} operating systems. But when your primary target platforms
are Windows and {MAC} and you desire a real native look and feel there, then you may find better suited ones in the Nim software repository.
Also, when you only need a minimal restricted GUI which is very easy to install on Windows and {MAC}, then you may find better suited packages
in the Nim package repository. _Android OS_ is currently not supported by GTK at all.  

While low level Nim bindings for GTK3 are already available since a few years, this one is an attempt to
provide real high level bindings with full type safety, full _Garbage Collector_ (_GC_) support and an idiomatic
_Application Programming Interface_ (_API_)

The low level bindings available at https://github.com/ngtk3 where generated with the Nim tool `c2nim` directly from the _C_ header files, are already tested
with some applications (https://github.com/ngtk3/NEd[NEd Nim Editor], https://github.com/StefanSalewski/nim-chess3[Chess Game])
and generally work fine. Indeed missing Garbage Collector support is generally not really a problem, as widgets are generally
put into containers and were automatically deleted together with its parents due to GTK's reference counting.

Still there can be some demand for really high level bindings -- so this repository tries to provide them.

High level GTK3 bindings, as available for many other programming languages like _Python_, _Ruby_ or _D_ already,
would have these advantages:

* full Garbage Collector support -- you should never have to free resources manually
* Widgets are Nim objects, so inheritance and sub-classing can be used
* full type safety -- no needs for casts or other unsafe and dangerous operations

These high level bindings are based on _{GIR}_, an _XML_ based database like interface description. Compared to the _C_ header
files this description gives us more and deeper information about data types and function calls, for example ownership transfer of objects and
in or out direction of procedure variables,  which makes writing the glue code much easier.
And it should work with no or minimal
modifications also for the upcoming GTK4.

Unfortunately there are also some drawbacks:

* The Application Programming Interface (API) will be different from what is known from _C_ API, so using _C_ examples or _C_ tutorials is not really straight forward 
* The high level source code will differ from available _C_ examples, so there would be a big demand for tutorials
* We need a lot of glue code, which has much room for bugs. So much testing is necessary.
* There is some overhead due to indirect calls, leading to some code size increase and minimal
performance loss.

NOTE: The new package name is *gintro*, short for _{GIR}_. The previous name was _nim-gi_, but the hyphen is deprecated for package names, as is the
nim prefix.

== Current state of these bindings

We are still in an early stage, but it is already more than a proof of concept. GTK and related libraries have many thousand of
callable functions and nearly as many data types. Testing all that is nearly impossible for a small team with limited resources.
The initial approach was to generate low level
bindings, which looked similar to the ones generated by the `c2nim` tool from the _C_ headers. After that was done, we have associated all
the _C_ structs and _GObject_ data types with Nim proxy objects. A well defined relation between these proxy object and the low level _C_ data types
should ensure fully automatic garbage collection. This is supported by smart type conversion, for example _C_ strings returned by `glib` library
are assigned to newly created Nim strings, while the memory of the _C_ strings is automatically freed. For most cases this seems to work. But there
exists a few more complicated cases, for example functions may return whole arrays of _C_ strings or other non elementary data types,
or function arguments or results may be so called _glists_,
list structures of `glib` library. These cases can not be processed automatically but needs carefully manual investigations. And there may be still functions and data
types missing: {GIR} query gives us many thousand lines of Nim interface code, and it is not really obvious if and what is missing.
Some functions and data types are missing for sure -- at least some low level ones, which are considered unneeded for high level bindings by {GIR}.
But maybe more is missing, we have to investigate that. Until now these bindings have been tested only for 64 bit Linux systems with GTK 3.22.

These basic libraries are already partly tested:

* GLib
* GObject
* GModule
* xlib
* Gio
* Atk
* Pango
* cairo
* GdkPixbuf
* Rsvg
* Gdk
* Gtk

In best case it should be possible to add more GObject based libraries to this list without larger modifications of the generator source code.
Unfortunately the bindings for the _cairo_ drawing library provided by {GIR} are only a minimal stub -- later we will have to extend it manually.  

== How to try it out

Of course you will need a working Nim installation with a recent compiler version and you have to ensure that GTK and related libraries are installed on your system. For some Linux
distributions which provide mainly pre-compiled software you may have to also install some GTK related developer files. 

This package now supports the _Nimble Package Manager_, so ideally a plain `nimble install gintro` should do. But as this package does not
only provide some plain text files, but uses {GIR} database query on your local computer to generate
binding files exactly matching your system, that does not work currently. We have to download the files, compile and execute
the `gen.nim` generator program and finally to install the generated bindings modules on your computer as a _nimble package_.

These instructions should be enough  for that:

----
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/stefansalewski/gintro
cd gintro
nimble prepare
nimble install
----

NOTE: Nimble prepare should run for about 20 seconds, it compiles and executes the generator program `gen.nim`.
Unfortunately we can not guarantee that the generator command  will be able to really build all the
desired modules. The built process highly depends on your OS and installed GTK version. For 64 bit Linux systems
with GTK 3.22 and all required dependencies installed it should work. For never GTK versions it may fail, when that GTK
release introduces for example new unknown data types like array containers. In that case manual fixes may be necessary.
The {GIR} based built process generates bindings customized to the OS where the generator is executed,
so for older GTK releases or a 32 bit system different files are created. Later we may also provide pre-generated
files for various OS and GTK versions, but building locally is preferred when possible. 

Now you can built `app0.nim` and launch it:

----
cd /tmp/gintro/examples/
nim c app0.nim
./app0
----

== A few basic examples

GTK3 programs can use still the old _GTK2_ design, where you first initialize the GTK library, create your widgets and finally enter the GTK main loop.
This style is still used in many tutorials as in http://zetcode.com/gui/gtk2/[Zetcode tutorial] or in the GTK book of A. Krause.
Or you can use the new _GTK3 App style_, this is generally recommended by newer original GTK documentation.
Unfortunately the GTK3 original documentation is mostly restricted to the GTK3 API documentation, which is generally very good, but makes
it not really easy for beginners to start with GTK. API docs and some basic introduction is available here:

* https://www.gnome.org/
* https://www.gtk.org/
* https://developer.gnome.org/
* https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/
* https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch01s04.html#id-1.2.3.12.5
* https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/stable/c.html.en

TIP: If you should decide to continue developing software with GTK, then you may consider installing the so called
`devhelp` tool. It gives you easy and fast access to the GTK API docs. For example, if you want to use a _Button Widget_ in your
GUI and wants to learn more about related functions and signals, you just enter _Button_ in that tool and are guided to
all the relevant information. 

We start with a minimal traditional old style example, which should be familiar to most of us:

[[t0.nim]]
[source,nim]
.t0.nim
----
# nim c t0.nim
import gintro/gtk

proc bye(w: Window) =
  mainQuit()
  echo "Bye..."

proc main =
  gtk.init()
  let window = newWindow()
  window.title = "First Test"
  window.connect("destroy", bye)
  window.showAll
  gtk.main()

main()
----

This is the traditional layout of GTK2 programs. When using this style then it is important to initialize the GTK library by calling `gtk.init()`
at the very beginning. Then we create the desired widgets, connect signals, show all widgets and finally enter the GTK main loop
by calling `gtk.main`. About connecting signals we will learn more soon, for now it is only important that we have to connect to
the destroy signal here to enable the user to terminate program execution by clicking the window close button. 

Now a really minimal but complete App style example, which displays an empty window.

NOTE: The source text of all these examples is contained in the examples directory. Unfortunately _github_
seems to not allow to include that sources directly into this document, so there may be minimal
differences between the source code displayed here and the sources in examples directory.

[[app0.nim]]
[source,nim]
.app0.nim
----
# app0.nim -- minimal application style example
# nim c app0.nim
import gintro/gtk
import gintro/gio except Application, newApplication # we want to use GTK application
#from gintro/gio import ApplicationFlags, scActivate, run

proc activate(app: Application) =
  let window = newApplicationWindow(app)
  window.title = "GTK3 & Nim"
  window.defaultSize = (200, 200)
  showAll(window)

proc main =
  let app = newApplication("org.gtk.example")
  connect(app, "activate", activate)
  discard run(app)

main()
----

In the `main proc` we create a new application and connect the activate signal to our `activate proc`, which then creates and displays
the still empty window. For this program we need the `gtk` module and also some procs and data types from `gio` module. As both modules
have a data type called `Application` (`gtk.Application` extends indeed the `gio.Application`) we can either qualify the `Application` data type and its `new proc`
with `gtk` prefix, or as we did here, exclude that from `gio` imports. Another solution would be to import from `gio` only what is really needed. 
The source code of this  minimal example is stored in the examples directory, you may `cd` into it and type `nim c app0.nim` to create
the executable.

//(Well not yet, as we provide no real nimble install. Copy app0.nim to nim_gi directory where the bindings live, or
//create symlinks for now.)

Various ways to set widget parameters are supported -- the number 1 to 6 refer to the comments below:

//. Setting widget parameters
[source,nim]
----
setDefaultSize(window, 200, 200) # <1>
gtk.setDefaultSize(window, 200, 200) # <2>
window.setDefaultSize(200, 200) # <3>
window.setDefaultSize(width = 200, height = 200) # <4>
window.defaultSize = (200, 200) # <5>
window.defaultSize = (width: 200, height: 200) # <6>
----

<1> proc call syntax
<2> optional qualified with module name prefix
<3> method call syntax
<4> named parameters
<5> tupel assignment
<6> tupel assignment with named members

Well, that empty window is really not very interesting. The GTK and Gnome team provides some GTK examples
at https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/.
The https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/3.22/c.html.en[C demos] seems to be most actual and complete,
and are easy to port to Nim. So we start with these,
but if you are familiar with the other listed languages, then you can try to port them to Nim as well.
Let us start with https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/3.22/button.c.html.en as it is
still short and easy to understand, but shows already some interesting topics.

image::NimGTK3Button.png[]

The _C_ code looks like this:

[[button.c]]
[source,c]
.button.c
----
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

/*This is the callback function. It is a handler function which 
reacts to the signal. In this case, it will cause the button label's 
string to reverse.*/
static void
button_clicked (GtkButton *button,
                gpointer   user_data)
{
  const char *old_label;
  char *new_label;

  old_label = gtk_button_get_label (button);
  new_label = g_utf8_strreverse (old_label, -1);

  gtk_button_set_label (button, new_label);
  g_free (new_label);
}

static void
activate (GtkApplication *app,
          gpointer        user_data)
{
  GtkWidget *window;
  GtkWidget *button;

  /*Create a window with a title and a default size*/
  window = gtk_application_window_new (app);
  gtk_window_set_title (GTK_WINDOW (window), "GNOME Button");
  gtk_window_set_default_size (GTK_WINDOW (window), 250, 50);

  /*Create a button with a label, and add it to the window*/
  button = gtk_button_new_with_label ("Click Me");
  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), button);

  /*Connecting the clicked signal to the callback function*/
  g_signal_connect (GTK_BUTTON (button),
                    "clicked", 
                    G_CALLBACK (button_clicked), 
                    G_OBJECT (window));

  gtk_widget_show_all (window);
}

int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  GtkApplication *app;
  int status;

  app = gtk_application_new ("org.gtk.example", G_APPLICATION_FLAGS_NONE);
  g_signal_connect (app, "activate", G_CALLBACK (activate), NULL);
  status = g_application_run (G_APPLICATION (app), argc, argv);
  g_object_unref (app);

  return status;
}

Converting it to Nim is straight forward with some basic _C_ and Nim knowledge, and Nim does not force us
to convert its shape into all the classes known from pure _Object Orientated_ (_OO_) languages. We can either use the
Nim tool `c2nim` to help us with the conversion, or do it manually. Indeed `c2nim` can be very helpful by
converting _C_ sources to Nim. Most of the time it works well. Personally I generally pre-process _C_ files, for example
by removing too strange `macros` and `defines, or by replacing strange constructs, like _C_ `for loops`, to simpler
ones like `while loops`. Then I apply `c2nim` to the _C_ file and finally manually compare the result line by line and
fine tune the Nim code. But for this short source text we may do all that manually and finally get something like
this:

[[button.nim]]
[source,nim]
.button.nim
----
# nim c button.nim
import gintro/[gtk, glib]
import gintro/gio except Application, newApplication

proc buttonClicked (button: Button) =
  button.label = utf8Strreverse(button.label, -1)

proc activate (app: Application) =
  let window = newApplicationWindow(app)
  window.title = "GNOME Button"
  window.defaultSize = (250, 50)
  let button = newButton("Click Me")
  window.add(button)
  button.connect("clicked",  buttonClicked)
  window.showAll

proc main =
  let app = newApplication("org.gtk.example")
  connect(app, "activate", activate)
  discard app.run

main()
----

Again we have the basic shape already known from <<app0.nim>> example: `Main proc` creates the application, connect
to the activate signal and finally runs the application. When GTK launches the application and emits the `activate` signal, then
our activate proc is called, which creates a main window containing a button widget. That button is again connected with a
signal, in this case named `clicked`. That signal is emitted by GTK whenever that button is clicked with the mouse and results
in a call of our provided `buttonClicked()` proc. The procs connected to signals are called _callbacks_ and generally got the widget
on which the signal was emitted as first parameter. They can also get a second optional parameter of arbitrary type -- we will
see that in a later example. This callback here gets only the button itself as parameter, and it's task is to reverse the
text displayed by the button. Not very interesting basically, but we are indeed using the _glib_ function `utf8Strreverse()`
for this task. While that function internally works with `cstrings`, and in _C_ we have to free the memory of the returned `cstring`,
in our Nim example that is done automatically by Nim's Garbage Collector. When you compare our example carefully with the _C_ code,
then you may notice a difference. The _C_ code passes the window containing the button as an additional parameter to the
callback function, but that parameter is not really used. We simple ignore it here, as it is not used at all.
//and I assume that passing a widget in this way in our nim code
//may not work already currently. Fortunately widgets as optional parameter are not often needed, and we will try to make that
//working soon...
In one of the following examples you will learn how passing (nearly) arbitrary parameters in a type safe way is done.  
Another difference is, that  the _C_ code returns an `integer` status value returned by `g_application_run()` to the _OS_. We
could do the same by using the `quit() proc` of Nim's _OS_ module, but as that would give us no additional benefit, we simply ignore it.

TIP: The command `nim c sourcetext.nim` generates an executable which contains code for runtime checks and debugging,
which increases executable size and decreases performance.
After you have tested your software carefully, you may give the additional parameter `-d:release` to avoid this. For the `gcc` backend
you may additional enable _Link Time Optimization_ (_LTO_), which reduces executable size further. To enable LTO you may put
a `nim.cfg` file in your sources directory with content like

----
path:"$projectdir"
nimcache:"/tmp/$projectdir"
gcc.options.speed = "-march=native -O3 -flto -fstrict-aliasing"
----   

With that optimization, your executable sizes should be in the range of about 50 kB only!

=== Optional, type safe parameters for callbacks

The next example shows, how we can pass (nearly) arbitrary parameters to our connect procs.
We pass a string, an object from the stack, a reference to an object allocated on the heap
and finally a widget (in this case the application window itself, you may also try passing
another button). As the main window itself is a so called GTK `bin` and can contain only one
single child widget, we create a container widget, a vertical box in this case, fill that box with
some buttons, and add that box to the window.

Compile and start this example from the command line and watch what
happens when you click on the buttons.

[[connect_args.nim]]
[source,nim]
.connect_args.nim
----
# nim c connect_args.nim
import gintro/[gtk, glib]
import gintro/gio except Application, newApplication

type
  O = object
    i: int

proc b1Callback(button: Button; str: string) =
  echo str

proc b2Callback(button: Button; o: O) =
  echo "Value of field i in object o = ", o.i

proc b3Callback(button: Button; r: ref O) =
  echo "Value of field i in ref to object O = ", r.i

proc b4Callback(button: Button; w: ApplicationWindow) =
  if w.title == "Nim with GTK3":
    w.title = "GTK3 with Nim"
  else:
    w.title = "Nim with GTK3"

proc activate (app: Application) =
  var o: O
  var r: ref O
  new r
  o.i = 1234567
  r.i = 7654321
  let window = newApplicationWindow(app)
  let box = newBox(Orientation.vertical, 0)
  window.title = "Parameters for callbacks"
  let b1 = newButton("Nim with GTK3")
  let b2 = newButton("Passing an object from stack")
  let b3 = newButton("Passing an object from heap")
  let b4 = newButton("Passing a Widget")
  b1.connect("clicked",  b1Callback, "is much fun.")
  b2.connect("clicked",  b2Callback, o)
  b3.connect("clicked",  b3Callback, r)
  b4.connect("clicked",  b4Callback, window)
  box.add(b1)
  box.add(b2)
  box.add(b3)
  box.add(b4)
  window.add(box)
  window.showAll

proc main =
  let app = newApplication("org.gtk.example")
  connect(app, "activate", activate)
  discard app.run

main()
----

To prove type safety, we may modify one of the callback procs and watch the compiler output:

[source,nim]
----
proc b1Callback(button: Button; str: int) =
  discard # echo str
----

----
connect_args.nim(37, 5) template/generic instantiation from here
gtk.nim(-15021, 10) Error: type mismatch: got (ref Button:ObjectType, string)
but expected one of: 
proc b1Callback(button: Button; str: int)
----

It may be not always really obvious what the compiler wants to tell us, but at least we
are told that it got a string and expected an int.

Currently the connect function is realized by a Nim type safe `macro`. Connect accepts two or three
arguments -- the widget, the signal name and the optional argument. When the optional argument
is a ref (reference to objects on the heap) then it is passed as a reference, otherwise a deep copy
of the argument is passed. For the above code this means, that `r` and the `window` variables are passed
as references, while the string and the stack object are deep copied. Currently it is not possible
to release the memory of passed arguments again. This should be no real problem, as in most
cases no arguments are passed at all, and when arguments are passed, then they are general
small in size like plain numbers or strings, or maybe references to widgets which could not be freed
at all, as they are part of the GUI. Later we may add more variants of that connect macro.

NOTE: Navigation can be hard for beginners. You may have basic knowledge of GTK and want
to build a GUI for your application. But how to find what you need. Well, we offer no separate 
automatically generated API documentation currently, as that is not really helpful. In most cases
it is easy to just guess Nim symbol names, proc parameters and all that. Using a smart editor
with good `nimsuggest` support further supports navigation -- for example `NEd` shows us
all the needed proc parameters when we move the cursor on a proc name, or we press  kbd:[Ctrl+W] and jump
to the definition of that symbol. For unknown stuff the original _C_ function name is often a good starting point.
Assume you don't know much about GTK's buttons, but you know that you want to have a button in 
your GUI application. GTK generally offers generator functions containing the string `new` in their name.
So it is easy to guess that there exists a _C_ function named `gtk_button_new`. That name is also
contained in the bindings files, in this case in `gtk.nim`. So we open that file in a text editor and search for
that term. So it is really easy to find first starting points for related procs and data types. Most data types
are located near by their related functions, so you should be able to find all relevant information fast.
Remember the GTK `devhelp` tool, and use also `grep` or the `nimgrep` variant.

== Extending or sub-classing Widgets

I may occur that we want to attach additional information to GTK widgets
by extending or subclassing them. Doing this is supported
by providing for each widget class not only a corresponding new() proc which returns 
the newly created widget, but also
a init() proc, which gets an uninitialized variable of the (extended) widget type as argument and
initializes that variable with a newly created
GTK widget . Initializing the added fields is
done separately by the user. The following code shows a GTK button, which is
extended with a counter member field. That counter is decreased for
each button click. The amount of decrease (5) is passed to the callback as a int parameter.

[[count_button.nim]]
[source,nim]
.count_button.nim
----
# nim c count_button.nim
import gintro/[gtk, glib]
import gintro/gio except Application, newApplication

type
  CountButton = ref object of Button
    counter: int

proc buttonClicked (button: CountButton; decrement: int) =
  dec(button.counter, decrement)
  button.label = "Counter: " & $button.counter 
  echo "Counter is now: ", button.counter

proc activate (app: Application) =
  var button: CountButton
  let window = newApplicationWindow(app)
  window.title = "Count Button"
  initButton(button, "Counting down from 100 by 5")
  button.counter = 100
  window.add(button)
  button.connect("clicked",  buttonClicked, 5)
  window.showAll

proc main =
  let app = newApplication("org.gtk.example")
  connect(app, "activate", activate)
  discard app.run

main()
----

In this example we have to define our new widget type first, then we have to
declare a variable of that type and pass that variable to the init() proc.

== CSS styles, GErrors and Exceptions

image::NimGTK3Label.png[]

Often GTK beginners ask how one can apply custom styles to GTK widgets, for example custom colors.
While in most cases the use of custom colors gives just ugly results, as the custom colors generally do
not match well with the default color scheme, it is good to know how we can do it. For GTK3 styles are
applied to widgets by using _Cascading Style Sheets_ (_CSS_). You may find C example code similar to this:

[[label.c]]
[source,c]
.label.c
----
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30791670/how-to-style-a-gtklabel-with-css
// gcc `pkg-config gtk+-3.0 --cflags` test.c -o test `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0`
#include <gtk/gtk.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    gtk_init(&argc, &argv);
    GtkWidget *window = gtk_window_new(GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);
    GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new("Label");
    GtkCssProvider *cssProvider = gtk_css_provider_new();
    char *data = "label {color: green;}";
    gtk_css_provider_load_from_data(cssProvider, data, -1, NULL);
    gtk_style_context_add_provider(gtk_widget_get_style_context(window),
                                   GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER(cssProvider),
                                   GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER);
    g_signal_connect(window, "destroy", G_CALLBACK(gtk_main_quit), NULL);
    gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), label);
    gtk_widget_show_all(window);
    gtk_main();
}
----

Converting that to Nim is again straight forward:

[[label.nim]]
[source,nim]
.label.nim
----
# nim c label.nim
import gintro/[gtk, glib]
import gintro/gio except Application, newApplication

proc activate(app: Application) =
  let window = newApplicationWindow(app)
  let label = newLabel("Yellow text on green background")
  let cssProvider = newCssProvider()
  let data = "label {color: yellow; background: green;}"
  #discard cssProvider.loadFromPath("doesnotexist")
  discard cssProvider.loadFromData(data)
  let styleContext = label.getStyleContext

For this example we create a plain label widget with some text. To colorize it, we generate a
CssProvider and load it with a textual description of of our desired colors. Then we extract the
style context from the label and add our CssProvider to it.

The last parameter of the _C_ function gtk_css_provider_load_from_data() is of type GError and can
be used in _C_ code to detect runtime errors. The _C_ code above just passes NULL to ignore this error.
For Nim we map that GError argument to _exceptions_. To test what happens in Nim when an GError would
report an error condition, you may uncomment  function loadFromPath() in the code above. As the specified path
does not exist, we should get an exeption with a message telling us the problem. Of course in your real
code you may catch such exceptions with Nim's `try:` blocks. (You may also modify the data variable above to
an illegal CSS statement -- if the statement is seriously wrong, then you should get an exception from
loadFromData().
